### What is the difference between Runbear and Jenkins?

Jenkins is a widely-used automation server for developers, offering free and open-source
customization. It automates tasks and integrates with various tools. While Jenkins is
powerful for automating software development, it has drawbacks as an internal development
platform: complexity, maintenance efforts, permission challenges, and steep learning curve.

Runbear is a runbook management system that facilitates the sharing and automation of
operational knowledge for developers. With Runbear, you can share troubleshooting
procedures, service status checks, and service deployment instructions. This operational
knowledge can be automated and executed using natural language commands.

### What is the difference between Runbear and IDPs?

An internal developer platform (IDP) provides tools and services for efficient software
development within an organization. While IDPs aim to enhance the developer experience
and productivity, their implementation and maintenance can be resource-intensive.

Runbear is a knowledge management system that can be automated. By integrating Large
Language Models, Runbear offers a more intuitive user experience compared to traditional
IDPs.
