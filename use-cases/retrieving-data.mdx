Efficient information retrieval is vital for handling service operations. For example,
you may need to retrieve user information from a database to handle a customer
request.

However, building backoffice systems and using SQL queries can be time-consuming and
complex. Enter Runbear, a low-code ChatOps platform that simplifies these tasks. With
Runbear, you can quickly set up runbooks and retrieve information with ease.

## Setup Runbooks for Getting Information

Check out [Runbook Management](/runbook-management) page to learn how to create a runbook. For this example, we will create a runbook that retrieves information from a database.

### Using `psql` to Retrieve Information from PostgreSQL

Use this command to retrieve information from a PostgreSQL database:

```bash
psql postgresql://${username}:${password}@postgres:5432 -A -c "SELECT ..."
```

You can Environment Secrets to store the credential data. Check out [Managing Secrets](/runbook-management#managing-secrets) section to learn more.

## Retreiving Information

You can just ask Runbear to run the runbook you created. Runbear will execute the runbook and return the result. Check out [Runbook Execution](/runbook-execution) page to learn how to execute a runbook.
