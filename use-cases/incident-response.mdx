Runbear is a tool for incident response. It helps you resolve incidents faster
by providing additional information about the incident and by automating tasks
that helps you to recover services.

## Runbooks for Incident Response

### Checking Service Status

Checking the service status is the initial step in incident response. It allows
you to assess the extent of the incident and determine the subsequent actions.
Refer to the [Checking Service Status](/checking-service-status) page to
understand the setup process for runbooks.

### Checking Latest Updates

Most incidents occur as a result of changes, such as code changes, infrastructure
modifications, or altered settings. By including suspected changes in incident
alerts, you can swiftly identify the causes and resolve the incident.

For example, to check the latest deployments in GitHub, you can use the following
command:

<Warning>Multi-line command block is not supported at the moment.</Warning>

```bash
curl -L \
  -H "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${github_token}"\
  -H "X-GitHub-Api-Version: 2022-11-28" \
  https://api.github.com/repos/OWNER/REPO/deployments
```

You can configure secret values on the Secrets page. For more information,
please refer to the [Managing Secrets](/runbook-management#managing-secrets)
page.

## Attaching Runbear to Incident Alerts

You probably receive alerts from services such as Datadog, Cloudwatch, or
Grafana. In many cases, although these alerts provide you with an abnormal
metrics, they don't provide you with enough information to identify the cause
and resolve the incident.

Runbear can be attached to any incident alerting system that supports webhooks.
To attach Runbear to your incident alerting system, you will need to create a
new webhook in Runbear and then configure your incident alerting system to send
alerts to that webhook.

### Step 1. Create a Slack Workflow

To create a Slack workflow, access the Workflow Builder menu located under Tools.

### Step 2. Add a Step to Post the Message with `@Runbear` Mentioned

Select `Messages > Send a message to a channel` to add a step. Type the command you want to execute in the message field and mention `@Runbear` in the message.

Copy the webhook URL from the workflow page.

### Step 3. Add the Webhook URL to Your Incident Alerting System

Most of the alerting system supports calling a webhook when an alert is triggered. Add the URL you copied from Step 2 to your incident alerting system.
