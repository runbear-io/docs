Do you find yourself constantly needing to check the status of various services?
Are you frequently bombarded with requests from colleagues to verify if a service
is functioning properly? Monitoring service liveness, CPU usage, database disk usage,
or DNS status can be a daunting task, especially if you're not familiar with the
technical intricacies involved.

## The Problem: Dashboards Are Not Enough

You must have dashboards and tools to monitor service status. But these tools are
not for everyone. Complicated dashboards and relying on engineers slow things down.

## The Solution: Prepare Runbooks for Checking Statuses

But here comes Runbear, an easy-to-use tool that automates system checks without
needing technical knowledge or special access.

With Runbear, you don't have to deal with complex dashboards anymore. Just ask questions, and you'll get real-time updates on service health. This gives non-tech people the power to make informed decisions and take action on their own, saving time and boosting productivity.

## Setup Checking Service Status

### Create a Runbook Document for Checking Statuses

There are various ways to check the service health. If you have an API for health check, you can use a simple `curl` command.

<Check>
  Make sure to turn on the `Executable` and `Autorun` options for the code
  block.
