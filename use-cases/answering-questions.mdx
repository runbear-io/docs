Are you tired of answering repetitive questions? Do people refuse to search for documents even when they're readily available? If you're frustrated with constantly having to provide information that already exists, we have a solution for you!

## Problem: In Fact, Asking Questions is Easier Than Searching

Let's face it, asking a person for information is often easier than searching through documents, reading through them, and extracting the specific information we need. It's a common challenge to get people to take the time to search for answers before asking someone else. This can be especially frustrating when you have already gone through the effort of creating comprehensive documents and resources for your team or organization.
